              Cloth Simulation in C

          Progress: <strong>Done!</strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
            I've always seen videos of cloth simulations and wondered how they
            were made and optimized. So, I used some resources and wrote my own
            over this past weekend which suprisngly was a lot simpler than I expected
            it to be. I chose to use SDL2 for the graphics library and C for the
            langauge.
        </p>



        <p>
            I had seen video's prior behind the process of building the sim and knew
            that the first step was drawing a grid of points to the screen(After setting
            up and SDL window of course). So I created a struct for each point holding
            each x and y position and populated a 2D array of these particles. After
            the data structure was handled I could easily change the arrays parameters
            to customize the size of grid.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the grid of particles set up we now need to have them react to
            gravity and after some surfing the web I found that Verlet Integration
            is a great way to integrate motion and trajectory of particles. With
            this equation I made a function to update the particles position within
            the main loop for a final result of the particles falling into the abyss.
            (I made the gravity variable low for demonstration because it would fall
            before I could capture it :p).
        </p>

        <p>
            Next we need chains/links between each point to act as a restriction
            so that the points have a set distance where if they exceed they get
            pulled back together. Luckily, the wikipedia page for Verlet Integration
            also discussed constraint calcualtion. I pinned the top row and after the 
            constraints were added and drawn the simulation was basically already working!

        </p>

        <p>
            Its no fun without the ability to move and alter the cloth so I added
            the option to delete a particle with left click and applying a drag
            force with right click.
