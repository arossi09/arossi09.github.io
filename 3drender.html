          Progress: <strong>Halfway Done(I think)</strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
          Lately, I've been interested to gain a deeper understanding of the
          fundamental components that power a graphics API behind the scenes,
          such as
          <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGl</a> or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX</a> so I have
          decided to build my own 3D Renderer. I'm currently using
          <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/">Real-Time Rendering</a>
          and
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0:-getting-started"
            >tinyrenderer</a
          >
          guide as reference while I build the project from the ground up using
          C.
        </p>

        <p>
          To start the project off I used the same strategy from the tiny
          renderer guide of reading and writing to a TGA file format. This
          involved building my own library to be able to read, write, create,
          and manipulate TGA files. Currently, the library is 90% finished
          however, it does not support all the functionalities that are
          available within TGA header options to save focus for the main goal of
          the project. This library opened up the capabilities of drawing to an
          image format with code. A simple test was run encapsulating all
          functionality by creating an image drawing a triangle and
          saving/writing it to disk.
        </p>

        <img id="project_image" src="images/triangles.png" />

        <p>
          The next step in the project was utilizing OBJ files to load models. I
          would create my own library to parse object files into a data
          structure I would use to draw each set of vertices or faces to the
          screen. I also improved the triangle algorithm to fill the triangle
          with the specified color using the barycentric coordinate system. With
          the new triangle algorithm, I created a simple light source pointing
          at the model and calculated the intensity of the light on each face
          with the normal of the triangle and the direction of the light source.

        <h6 style="text-align: center">
          Utah Teapot with interpolated triangles--no z-buffer
        </h6>
        <p>
          As you can see by the spout of the teapot, the current state of the
          renderer did not have a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">z-buffer</a> or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm"
            >painters algorithm</a
          >
          implemented, so I used the references I had to implement a z-buffer.
          The z-buffer keeps track of each pixel on the screen and compares to
          see which one is the nearest to the camera.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next step in the renderer was to use the texture coordinates("vt
          ...") from the object file to map the textures onto the triangles.
          After I updated the OBJ parsing library to hold the vertex texture
          values I altered my triangle function to interpolate the textures
          throughout each triangle. My approach was to save the texture
          coordinates and send them to the triangle function where the u and v
          coordinates would be calculated based on the weights from the
          barycentric coordinates. I ran into the issue of the texture being
          flipped because of how I designed my TGA loader. For my use, I have it
          so that the image's origin is in the bottom left and builds its way up
          to the top right, however, for the texture coordinates this was
          swapped. So I had to invert the coordinates by subtracting them by 1.
