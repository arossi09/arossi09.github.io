        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px">3D Renderer</h1>
        <p>
          Recentally I have delved into the field of computer graphics and
          wanting to have a better understanding of the core components that go
          on under the hood of a graphics API such as
          <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGl</a> or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX</a> I have
          decided to build my own 3D Renderer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm currently using
          <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/">Real-Time Rendering</a>
          and
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0:-getting-started"

          guide as reference while I build the project from the ground up using
          C.

          To start the project off I used the same strategy from the
          tinyrenderer guide of reading and writing to a TGA file format. This
          involved building my own library to be able to read, write, create,
          and manipulate TGA files. Currently the library is 90% finished
          however does not support all the functionalities that are available
          within TGA header options to save focuse for the main goal of the
          project. With this library it opened up the
          capabilities of drawing to a image format with code. A simple test was
          run encapsilating all functionality by creating an image drawing a
          triangle and saving/writing it to disk.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next step in the project was utilizing OBJ files to load in
          models. I would create my own library to parse object files into a
          datastructure I would use to draw each set of verticies to the screen.
