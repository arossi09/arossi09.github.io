        <h4>Progress: <strong>Halfway Done(I think)</strong></h4>
        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px">3D Renderer</h1>
        <p>
          Recentally I have delved into the field of computer graphics and
          wanting to have a better understanding of the core components that go
          on under the hood of a graphics API such as
          <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGl</a> or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX</a> I have
          decided to build my own 3D Renderer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm currently using
          <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/">Real-Time Rendering</a>
          and
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0:-getting-started"
            >tinyrenderer</a
          >
          guide as reference while I build the project from the ground up using
          C.
        </p>

        <h6>Heart before I implemented Bresenhams Line Algorithm</h6>
        <p>
          To start the project off I used the same strategy from the
          tinyrenderer guide of reading and writing to a TGA file format. This
          involved building my own library to be able to read, write, create,
          and manipulate TGA files. Currently the library is 90% finished
          however does not support all the functionalities that are available
          within TGA header options to save focuse for the main goal of the
          project. With this library it opened up the capabilities of drawing to
          a image format with code. A simple test was run encapsilating all
          functionality by creating an image drawing a triangle and
          saving/writing it to disk.

        <h6>Utah Teapot loaded in with OBJ library</h6>
        <p>
          The next step in the project was utilizing OBJ files to load in
          models. I would create my own library to parse object files into a
          datastructure I would use to draw each set of vertices or face to the
          screen. I also improved the triangle algorithm to fill the triangle
          with the specifed color using the bacyrentric coordiante system. With
          the new triangle algorithm I created a simple light source pointing at
          the model and calculated the intensity of the light on each face with
          the normal of the triangle and the direction of the light source.

        <h6>Utah Teapot no z-buffer</h6>
        <p>
          As you can see by the spout of the teapot the current state of the
          renderer did not have a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">z-buffer</a> or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm"
            >painters algorithm</a
          >
          implemented, so I used the references I had to implement a z-buffer.
          The z-buffer keeps track of each pixel on the screen and compares to
          see which one is the nearest to the camera.
