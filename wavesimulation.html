        <h4 >Progress: <strong>Complete</strong></h3>
        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px">3D wave simulation</h1>
        <p>
          Currently, the project consists of a representation of sin and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a>
          waves along with GUI support from the
          <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui library</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As of now there are two ways to draw the sin and Perlin noise wave.
          The wave can be drawn as points in space connected into polygons using
          a procedural plane generation, or by individual boxes that change
          position based on the wave values.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simulation is currently being processed by the CPU which I hope to
          later transfer over to GPU handling involving shaders for better
          performance. The next step, as of now, would be adding lighting to the
          world so the simulation isn't restricted to only using the wireframe
          mode.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simulation has a dynamic light source which applies diffusion and
          specular light to objects in the world. In short the lighting is being
          calculated within the fragment shader where the ambient level is the
          color of the object alone, the diffusion level is the result of the
          angle that the light hits the object using its normal vector, and the
          specular light is a result of how close the the cameras position is to
          the reflection vector from the light source.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also added the ability to drag and move around the light source,
          this involved calculating the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume"
            >AABB(Axis-aligned bounding box)</a
          >
          of the light and converting the 2D cordinate of the click to a 3D ray
          in the world. Then all I had to do was use
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_method"
            >Ray-AABB intersection</a
          >
          formulas to calculate if the click intersects with the box.
